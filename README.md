XCPM
----

The project goal is to add XCPM support for self compiled XNU kernels.

The first step is to write a script (setupXNU.sh) to download and install the required tools (99% completed). 

The next step is to write a helper script to construct the xcpm_library.

The next step is to patch the XNU makefiles and source code so that it calls the xcpm functions from the xcpm_library.
